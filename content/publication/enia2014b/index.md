abstract: "Why do states that consider themselves party to the nuclear nonproliferation regime--whether as de jure signatories to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) or as de facto nonproliferators or nonnulcear weapons states (NNWS)--have difficulty signing and implementing measures that would seemingly strengthen the regime? The theoretical framework employed in this chapter demonstrates that there are fundamental and strategic reasons why building nuclear stakeholders is likely to be extremely difficult. The essential mix of qualities of the public goods being provided across the regime leads to a wide variety of inherent collective action challenges."
