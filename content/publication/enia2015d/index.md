abstract: "Mr. President, why has the red line been crossed — -? It was April 26, 2013, and U.S. President Barack Obama was sitting next to the King of Jordan, holding the customary photo op and press conference, prior to their more formal meeting. The reporter’s question was the same one that happened to be on every other reporter’s mind. President Obama sensed this, cutting the reporter off and asking, “You guys all have the same question?"
